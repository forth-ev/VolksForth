This is volksForth 3.8 for the Sorbus Computer
https://github.com/SvOlli/sorbus/

It is a very early version. 

The sourcecode can be recompiled using the volksForth target
compiler. Currently only the 6502 target compiler for the Atari ST
works. I'm workin on getting the 6502 target compiler working again,
as well as a target compiler in CP/M and MS-DOS volksForth.
