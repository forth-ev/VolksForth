#+Title: VolksForth MS-DOS for Atari Portfolio

The Atari Portfolio is a portable, MS-DOS compatible palmtop computer
released by Atari in 1989
(https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atari_Portfolio).

The Portfolio uses an Intel 80C88 CPU running at 4.9152 MHz and runs
"DIP Operating System 2.11" (DIP DOS), an operating system mostly
compatible to MS-DOS 2.11, but with some DOS 2.xx functionality
lacking and some internal data structures more compatible with DOS
3.xx. It has 128 KB of RAM and 256 KB of ROM which contains the OS and
built-in applications. The on-board RAM is divided between system
memory and local storage (the C: drive). The LCD is monochrome without
backlight and had 240×64 pixels or 40 characters × 8 lines.
