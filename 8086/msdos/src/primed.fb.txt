\\ Simple Editor for Installation                    cas 10nov05

If the Full-Screen Editor cannot be used during installation
(incompatible display hardware), the screens must be altered
with this Simple Editor "PRIMED", which contains only one word
definition::

Usage: Select Screen nn with command "nn LIST",
  and edit a screen with "ll NEW". It is only possible to
  rewrite whole lines. ll is the first line where the editing
  should start. The editing can be terminated by entering an
  empty line (just RETURN). Each RETURN will store the editied
  line and the whole screen will be reprinted.

This text was created by: "2 LIST  4 NEW" and then entering
this text
The headerline (Line 0) was added later after leaving "NEW"
with an empty line (just RETURN) and a new editing command
"0 NEW".
